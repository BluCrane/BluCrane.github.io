<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to BluCrane.</h3>

<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Websites</h3>

<p>Your website is virtual real estate. Just like your business premises or home, its appearance and user friendliness will have an effect on visitors. Sloppy, generic or amateurish websites chase potential clients away and devalue your brand.</p>

<p>BluCrane can help you to take advantage of the growing internet market by delivering cost-effective, fully functional websites from as little as R2000.</p>

<a name="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Content Creation</h3>

<p>In order to get the desired results (more clients or a bigger audience) individuals or businesses have to create content that is compelling, well written and suited to their target market. Even Google has emphasised the importance of quality content in their latest search algorithm. Investing in professionally created content has become indispensable for successful media projects. Weak, badly written content can, and will, affect your business reputation and devalue your brand.</p>

<h3>
<a name="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data Visualisation</h3>

<p>We use the latest data visualisation tools to convert complex data into informative images and interactive graphics that communicate with your audience in a powerful new way.</p>

<p>In a world that is increasingly suffering from information overload, data visualisation offers a succinct and effective way to convey product, business, research or service information, while decreasing the risk of audience fatigue.</p>
